### Ember js project deployement

Deployement of ember js is quite easy , u need first just to configure ur env file in `config/environment`
to set the production & dev server credentials after that u can use the magic command `ember build --prod`
the `prod` flag is to use the production server credentials 
Then ur porject will be ready in `/dist` folder u need just to copy it and put it in ur `public_html` folder
and enjoy :)
